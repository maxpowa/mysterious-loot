A mysterious loot mod for Minecraft

Ideas:
Loot System -> Pixel Dungeon
    - You can get books/wands/weapons from mobs as random drops, but you don’t know what they do until you use them
    - They could be negative effects or positive effects
        ex; You might have a sword that once you use you’re unable to take out of the position that it is in your inventory, until you find a book that removes curses, you would only find this book by testing books until you get one.
        ex2; you might have armor that doesn’t come off because of a curse, again the only way to take it off would be a book that removes curses or using it until it breaks.
    - Some wands might have powerful spells, but only useful for a short amount of time
    - Spellbooks work similar to wands, but take slightly longer to cast
    - What books/wands/weapons have what effects depend on the server/world. Maybe when the world is created it's given a "seed" for the things.
        eg; server1 uses mod, Red Book is a fire spell, but server2's Red Book is a poison spell - the only way to find out what is what would be by using them, sort of like in-world research. Once you find out what an object does it would properly show its name
    - The more powerful the object, the higher chance that is is cursed
    - In most cases, weapons more powerful than an iron sword will have a ~90% chance of being cursed - making them risky but also rewarding
        - Again, you don't know whether or not the weapon is cursed until you've used it.

Spells:
    - lightning zap
        - chaining maybe
        - possible different levels
        - extra damage to skeletons
    - fireball
        - lights entity on fire, dealing some damage at the same time
        - extra damage to fleshy mobs - zombies, animals
        - ineffective against slimes / fire resistance
        - doesn't work underwater ofc
    - ice spike
        - similar to an arrow
        - deals extra damage to slimes
        - 1000 slowness for a quarter second on hit
        - doesn't work in the nether
    - rock bind
        - binds a mob to it's current position for some time (may depend on spell level)
        - even hitting the mob will not move it
        - ineffective against endermen, they just teleport out
        - does not work if mob is in midair / flying mobs (blaze)
    - ender jump (self spell)
        - teleports the user to the block they are looking at, within some range
        - deals damage half as much as an enderpearl jump would
        - the rest of the damage is applied as AOE
    - iron-blood transformation (self spell)
        - Yes, this is a Hitsugi No Chaika reference
        - temporarily gives strength, jump boost and resistance
        - drops hunger drastically, also induces weakness after usage (proportional to length used)
        - if used for too long, the player may also be injured when ending usage
        - poison is much more effective when under the effects
        - user's skin gets a red tint
    - splash
        - Ineffective against literally everything except Endermen.
        - Endermen will quake in their ender-boots when they see you coming
        - When used against slimes, they may drop diluted slime -> can be crafted 2x2 to make normal slime (no damage though)
    - soul binding
        - can be used on pets/other players to prevent them from being damaged by your spells
        - used for team combat
        - can be deactivated by punching the bound entity
        - only works one way, both players must use soul binding if they want to properly work as a team
    - life share (needs a better name)
        - will give another entity 1 heart at the cost of half of a heart of yours
        - best used for team combat, someone can act as a healer
        - can be used against undead, they will be damaged instead of healed (not very effective though)
        - also drops your hunger drastically
        - perhaps an AOE version that heals all soul-bound players 1 heart, costing you the amount of soul-bound players that are effected
    - shield cast (needs better name)
        - will give reciever temporary resistance 1, caster will get weakness
        - only works with soul-bound entities
        - has a limited number of uses as well
        - maximum range of 25 blocks
